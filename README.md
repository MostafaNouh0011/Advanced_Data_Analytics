## workplace scenarios

This certificate offers you a choice of several different workplace scenarios to use when completing each end-of-course project:

* Automatidata, featuring a fictional data consulting firm.

* TikTok, created in partnership with the short-form video hosting company.

* Waze, created in partnership with the realtime driving directions app.     (This is what I applied)


## Waze

### Project goal: 

Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

### Background: 

Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer.
